      <h1>About Light Pollution</h1>
      <p>Light pollution is a growing problem in urban areas. It not only obscures our view of stars but also has significant impacts on wildlife and human health. The introduction of artificial lights has transformed our nights, disrupting natural cycles and ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>What is Light Pollution?</h2>
        <p>Light pollution refers to the excessive or inappropriate use of artificial light. It can take many forms, from the glaring streetlights that disrupt our sleep to the skyglow that hides the stars. This overabundance of light has far-reaching consequences, affecting not just our view of the night sky but also the environment and human health.</p>

        <h2>Types of Light Pollution</h2>
        <p>Light pollution isn't just one thing - it comes in a few different forms, each with its own problems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Skyglow:</b> That hazy glow over cities that blocks out the stars. It's caused by light scattering in the atmosphere, reflecting off dust and water particles. This diffused light makes it difficult to see fainter stars and celestial objects.</li>
          <li><b>Glare:</b> Super bright lights that hurt your eyes and make it hard to see. Think of unshielded streetlights or those blinding headlights. Glare can cause discomfort, reduce visibility, and even create hazardous driving conditions.</li>
          <li><b>Light trespass:</b> When light spills over where it's not wanted, like into your neighbor's yard or bedroom window. Light trespass can disrupt sleep, create privacy issues, and waste energy.</li>
          <li><b>Clutter:</b> A jumble of bright lights that's confusing and distracting. Common in cities with tons of signs and lights. This visual clutter can be overwhelming, contribute to driver distraction, and diminish the aesthetic quality of the nighttime environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sources of Light Pollution</h2>
        <p>Where does all this extra light come from? Here are some of the main culprits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Cities and towns:</b> Streetlights, buildings, and those bright billboards all add to the problem. Poorly designed and excessive lighting in urban areas contribute significantly to skyglow and light trespass.</li>
          <li><b>Industrial areas:</b> Factories and warehouses often have powerful lights that shine into the night sky. These lights are often unshielded and contribute to light pollution over a wide area.</li>
          <li><b>Homes:</b> Even our porch lights, garden lights, and security systems can contribute if they're not designed carefully. Upward-facing lights and excessively bright outdoor lighting can contribute to skyglow and light trespass.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact on the Environment</h2>
        <p>Light pollution messes with nature's rhythm. Animals that rely on darkness get confused, and it can disrupt their feeding, mating, and migration. For example, nocturnal animals may become disoriented, birds may migrate off course, and sea turtles may be deterred from nesting on brightly lit beaches.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Impact on Human Health</h2>
        <p>Too much light at night messes with our sleep. It disrupts our natural sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm) and can even lead to health problems like insomnia, fatigue, and even more serious stuff like increased risk of certain cancers, obesity, and depression. Exposure to artificial light at night suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep.</p>
